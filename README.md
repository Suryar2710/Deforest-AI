# Deforest-AI


# Problem Statement

Deforestation is a major problem that the world is facing today. The detection of deforestation using traditional methods is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, there is a need for an automated system that can detect deforestation in real-time and at a low cost.
The objective of this project is to develop a system that can detect deforestation using ResNet. ResNet is a deep learning model that has been shown to be effective in image recognition tasks. By training ResNet on satellite images, we aim to develop a system that can accurately detect deforestation.


# Modules and Components Used

• User input : The option for the users to run our model on their images.
• Aggregate performance : Show the global results of our model on the given dataset.
• Sample exploration : Show the model results over each sample.
• Out-of-domain performance : Show the model results on a new dataset.
• Data flywheel : Collect user data that can help us improve our model.
• Dashboard and analytics : This component presents the forest data in a graphical format, providing an overview of the satellite images and the related data. It includes tools for analyzing and visualizing data, generating reports, and setting goals.
• Playground : This is the initial page made specifically just for the users to try the model on their images; we can also use this page to store the users’ uploaded images and their feedback.
• Overview: A page for reviewing our model’s performance and the data’s characteristics over our datasets.
